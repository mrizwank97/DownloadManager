Command-Line Based Internet Download Manager. It was a semester project of EE-353 Computer Networks. We were required to design software which would be able to download the content of any type from a remote host as well as local-host. It was our semester project for the course \textit{Computer Networks}. The focus of the project was purely on Socket Programming, Multithreading, and HTTP protocol. We had to examine the response headers to check if multiple TCP connections were supported by the server. The software has the functionality of downloading the content via a single connection and multiple connections, resume downloading in case of internet dis-connectivity, and metrics reporting.
